# How to use
This small programme is used to analysis the 1D X-ray diffraction results and some of the 2D X-ray, for instance the pole figure and the RSM. It support the general UXD file and the RAW file of the Bruker X-ray diffractor.

How to use:

Currently to import data, you can only use the add data action in the lib menu.

you can use the add group action in the lib menu to orginize your datasets.

At any dataset, you can right click to plot the data, see the details, rename/delete the dataset and so on.
